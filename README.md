Consciousness is metastable coordination: experience moves through semi-stable regimes (“attractors”) characterized by coupling strength and phase relations among subsystems (body, narrative, affect, attention).
“Expansion/boundlessness” corresponds to a regime with high global coherence + low narrative dominance, while rumination loops correspond to high narrative coupling + low cross-system integration.

Can we build an empirical early-warning system for human meaning spirals and expansion states using disciplined first-person data + dynamical signatures?

The answer releases with a methodological paper on Friday - February 6th 2026.

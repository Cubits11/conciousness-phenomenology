Consciousness is metastable coordination: experience moves through semi-stable regimes (“attractors”) characterized by coupling strength and phase relations among subsystems (body, narrative, affect, attention).
“Expansion/boundlessness” corresponds to a regime with high global coherence + low narrative dominance, while rumination loops correspond to high narrative coupling + low cross-system integration.

A reproducible bridge from lived micro-structure (“what exactly happened inside?”) to dynamical structure (“what kind of coordination would produce that?”) using a single unified schema.

Varela proposed this bridging program. Many labs do pieces of it. I am hoping to build a clean, open, end-to-end “operating system” that makes it doable for a rigorous individual researcher.

Research Question : Can we build an empirical early-warning system for human meaning spirals and expansion states using disciplined first-person data + dynamical signatures?

The answer releases with a methodological paper on Friday - February 6th 2026.
